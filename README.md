# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Dashboard-Excel-Analytics-Project- üè•
This project was developed to improve the efficiency of hospital emergency room operations and provide actionable insights through data visualization. Using Microsoft Excel, I built a dynamic and interactive dashboard that enables stakeholders to monitor, analyze, and make informed decisions related to patient admissions, wait times, satisfaction levels, and departmental referrals. The dashboard simplifies complex data into meaningful visual summaries that support better patient management and service improvement.

The entire workflow followed a systematic process‚Äîfrom business understanding to dashboard development‚Äîshowcasing my skills in data preparation, modeling, and visualization within Excel.
